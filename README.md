## ðŸ”¥ About the project
This is a subscription based React news app, where users can sign in with their GitHub account, see the post's previews, and become customers! Those who choose to become customers pay a recurring price with Stripe and are able to see the posts in its integrity. In this project I learned and practiced a lot of important concepts including: 
- Developing a **JAM Stack app** (Javascript, Api, and Markup)
- Third party authentication for login
- Using the `Next.JS` framework in order to use both **SSR** (Server Side Rendering) and **SSG** (Static Site Generation)
- Using `FaunaDB` to store users and subscription data in a Non-SQL database great for serverless applications
- Using **Stripe** to make easy and reliable payments via API
- Using **Prismic CMS** in order to store and edit the app's post
